# xJSFL Site
## Intro

This is an exported, static version of the old WordPress site for [xJSFL](https://github.com/davestewart/xjsfl):

Rather than running on a traditional web host, it is now served statically by Vercel, making it faster and more secure., at the expense of a forum and being able to leave comments.

As the codebase is no longer updated, and there are very few users these days, this isn't really an issue, however I wanted some way to provide the few users who may need access to the docs.

## Access

### Online

Visit the site at [xjsfl.com](https://xjsfl.com). 

### Local

Clone or download the site, then serve using your preferred method ([npx](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner) is simple if you have Node installed):

```bash
npx serve
```

Then access the site at the URL shown in the terminal, usually:

- http://localhost:3000
